<h1>Notes from my first class</h1>

<b>What is the web?</b>
<p>The web connects my computer with many others through the exchange of data.
  <br> The data are organised in <b>html files</b> that bounce back and forth from servers through a protocol called <em>HTTP</em>, or <em> Hypertext Transfer Protocol </em>.
  <br>
  <br>

  <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud721/l-3508959201/e-48329854/m-48480496">This video</a> is a good starting point.
</p>

<b>What is HTML?</b>
<p>HTML stands for <b>Hypertext Markup Language.</b> HTML is the language used to build pages that are visualised when a computer connects to a server.
  <br> A <strong> server </strong> is a central computer capable of storing all the information visualised by the computers connected to it through the HTTP protocol.
</p>

<b>HTML Attributes</b>
<p>HTML documents include attributes, that make the computer do stuff such as including links in the page. An example is the <b>HREF attribute</b>, used for links. The string of code looks like this:
  <br>
  <center><em> open brackets, A, href= "link", close brackets,some string of content that will be attached to the link, and then closing tag /A in brackets </em></center>
</p>

<b>It's never the machine, it's you</b>
<p>This is a popular say among programmers here in London. It means that whatever mistake your page shows, it's never the computer's fault.
  <br> Mistakes are generated by problems in your code that you will have to <em>debug</em>.
  <br> In fact, a computer interprets your instructions in a literal way, each sign corresponds to one operation that never changes. There is no space for nuances.
</p>

<b>Void tags</b>
<p>Void tags are called so because they don't have any content, hence they don't need to be opened and closed. So for example, the tag:

  <em><center>'BR'</em></center>
  Can be put in brackets and there's no need to open an close it, it's just a <b> break in the text</b>.</p>
</br>

<b>Inline and block elements</b>
<p><em>Inline</em> elements in an HTML page are elements that add or do something within a chunk of code, without separating it from the rest.
  <br>
  <em>Block</em> elements, on the other hand, create an invisible block that sets apart different parts of your code.
  <br> Noticeably, using an inline or a block element can sometimes produce similar results, but the ratio behind the operation is very different.
  <br> For example, the tag <em>BR</em> that we've seen earlier. Its purpose is just to break a line.
  <br> If we use the tag <em>P</em>, which stands for 'paragraph', the result may seem the same: a break in the paragraph. But the function is very different. The tag P creates a block around the paragraph, that will function - and display, depending on the
  CSS applied - very differently from the tag BR. </br>
